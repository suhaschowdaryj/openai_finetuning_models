    "# Fine-tune OpenAI models - text classification\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a step-by-step guide for our new `gpt-3.5-turbo` fine-tuning. We'll perform text classification using the [AG news dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amananandrai/ag-news-classification-dataset). This is a common dataset for text classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will go through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup:** Loading our dataset and filtering down to one domain to fine-tune on.\n",
    "2. **Data preparation:** Preparing your data for fine-tuning by creating training and validation examples, and uploading them to the `Files` endpoint.\n",
    "3. **Fine-tuning:** Creating your fine-tuned model.\n",
    "4. **Inference:** Using your fine-tuned model for inference on new inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this you should be able to train, evaluate and deploy a fine-tuned `gpt-3.5-turbo` model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on fine-tuning, you can refer to our [documentation guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning), [API reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning) or [blog post](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-5-turbo-fine-tuning-and-api-updates)"
